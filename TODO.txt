Stuff for anyone (these are items from the capstone requirements document)
- our JFrame needs
	- a caption and its own icon. 
- the "how to play" popup needs to be a class derived from JDialog (and not a JOptionPane)

Other stuff for anyone
- stats display needs to show which weapon is in use and how many rounds it has left
- docking with the station needs to allow user to buy new weapons, buy more rounds for weapon on board, buy health, trade in treasures to get space coins 
	(this is started by not fully working; one might say the hooks are in place)
- need to make sure the main ship can't be damaged while in orbit around a space station or weigh station 
- need to improve our ability to get out of orbit without going back into orbit right away
- need to make sure score is increased when asteroids (large and small) are shot
- docking should give us some points as well (but just the initial docking not repeatedly getting more points while docked)
- shooting spacetreasures should give us points but not as much as capturing the treasure
- shooting a space station or weigh station should deduct points (not a huge amount just enough to make it a disincentive)
- edit ClusterBomb.gif file to have multiple layers/panes (all exist as separate files, just need to be merged into a single animated gif file named ClusterBomb.gif)


Stuff for Ryan
- investigate how saveGame and loadGame works in PirateFrame and SpacePanel. then add the following items from PirateFrame to both saveGame and loadGame...
	private int score = 0;						// overall score in the game
	private int asteroidsHit = 0;				// count of how man weapons hit asteroids
	private int[] treasuresCaptured = new int[SpaceTreasureType.SPACE_CREDITS.ordinal()+1];
												// count of how man treasures were captured
	private int currency = 0;					// total currency available. Can trade in treasure for currency
	private boolean lastOrbitStatus = false;    // orbit status used to determine if a change in status happened
- modify LargeAsteroid to generate a random treasure when it is destroyed (should be returned with the collection of small asteroids already in being created). The lower the value of the treasure type the higher the probability it is created. 
- modify SmallAsteroid to do the same thing (randomly create treasure) but skip the first 3 types since small asteroids are harder to hit.


Stuff for Charles??
- Continuous random world generation
- Collect treasure
	- Treasure variation
- Docking with stations (charles)
	-- flesh out purchase of items
- Asteroids repelled from stations 
	(I made so they don't orbit but they still don't repel)

OPTIONAL ITEMS TO ADD
- Modify ship
- *Trade ships (go in between way stations)
	- avoid asteroids?
	- loot on ships


COMPLETED
-- added logic to buy things when docked. 
-- added logic so that space ship is always first in the objects list (this will make
	sure that r1 and 01 is always the spaceship when evaluating collisions
	
- added logic for ships to "collide" with treasures, capture their value and save it in PirateFrame array of treasures.
- added stats popup

- added welcome popup (william)
- Turn ship while mouse button is down (william)
- made stations fixed in space even when collided with (william)
- disable firing while in orbit (william)
