BUGS/MISTAKES
- missiles should have x velocity + that of the ship (charles)

GENERAL TODO *salutes*
- Finish the other weapons (charles)
	- consider using '1' '2' '3' etc. keys to swap weapons
- Revamp Menus and UI
	- this includes adding a dedicated 
- *Trade ships (go in between way stations)
	- ships defend selves? (maybe some do)
	- avoid asteroids?
	- loot on ships
	- generate way stations to travel to?
- Enemy ships and/or space monsters
	- hopefully we can recycle code from trade ships
- Modify player ship (MAJOR ADDITION)
	- this includes adding physical parts to the ship
	(not just statistical upgrades)
	- Considering a polygon based building system where player can
		draw parts.
	- building should require materials
- Visual effects (Particles that don't collide like smoke)

CONSIDERING TODO
- Inventory Limits?
	- Should ammo count exceed 99?
- Change Control Scheme
	- change the controls to where WASD or arrows control the
		ship and mouse aims the gun
	- use two joysticks in the case of mobile version

OPTIONAL ITEMS TO ADD
- 'Sell All' option
- - Lock To function (would help with ship building)
	- this function would enable a space object to be
		anchored to another based on relative location
		and angle (a dev method, like orbit or simCollide)
- Buy Materials from stations
- Revamp art


COMPLETED For Current Version

COMPLETED 1.0.0
- Fix the docking in progress prompt to where it doesn't pop up each time a collision is detected
- Docking with stations
	-- flesh out purchase of items
- Asteroids repelled from stations 
- Continuous random world generation
- need to improve our ability to get out of orbit without going back into orbit right away
- shooting spacetreasures should give us points but not as much as capturing the treasure
- shooting a space station or weigh station should deduct points (not a huge amount just enough to make it a disincentive)
- docking should give us some points as well (but just the initial docking not repeatedly getting more points while docked)
- need to make sure score is increased when asteroids (large and small) are shot
- the "how to play" popup needs to be a class derived from JDialog (and not a JOptionPane)
- our JFrame needs
	- a caption and its own icon. 
-- added logic to buy things when docked. 
-- added logic so that space ship is always first in the objects list (this will make
	sure that r1 and 01 is always the spaceship when evaluating collisions
	
- added logic for ships to "collide" with treasures, capture their value and save it in PirateFrame array of treasures.
- added stats popup

- added welcome popup (william)
- Turn ship while mouse button is down (william)
- made stations fixed in space even when collided with (william)
- disable firing while in orbit (william)
- added asteroidsHit, treasuresCaptured, currency, and lastOrbitStatus attributes to loadGame and saveGame methods.(Sam)
- modify LargeAsteroid to generate a random treasure when it is destroyed (should be returned with the collection of small asteroids already in being created). 
  The lower the value of the treasure type the higher the probability it is created.(Sam)
- modify SmallAsteroid to do the same thing (randomly create treasure) but skip the first 3 types since small asteroids are harder to hit.(skipped Steel, water, and SpaceCredits)
- need to make sure the main ship can't be damaged while in orbit around a space station or weigh station (Sam)
- stats display needs to show which weapon is in use and how many rounds it has left (Sam)
- Docking with the station allows to buy more health with space credits, buy more rounds for weapon on board, and trade treasures in for Space Credits (Sam)
- Have asteroidsHit increment in the stats display (Sam)
- Docking with the station needs to allow user to buy new weapons(Sam)
- edit ClusterBomb.gif file to have multiple layers/panes (Sam)
